# CS146_DataShuffling
Project 1 from Professor Potika's CS146 Data Structures and Algorithms class.

PART A:
 - Implemented data-shuffling program by reading from given file and putting lines into array
 - Shuffled array using Fisher-Yates algorithm
 - Wrote newly shuffled array element by element into a new file. 

PART B:
- Implemented a circular linked list
- Using a loop, kept deleting every kth node in the circular linked list until there was only 1 element left.
